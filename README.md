# *Fancy*NoteBot
FancyNoteBot is a clone of [NoteBot](http://notebot.fdossena.com/) (wich is a clone of Microsoft Sticky Notes without useless functionalities) and adds some of those "useless" functionalities back in. (But it still removes alot of uselessness.)

## Download

## Features
#### Same as NoteBot
- Stick notes on your desktop
- Can move, resize and zoom
- Custom colors
- Auto startup
- Support for high DPI screens and touch devices
#### *Fancy* features
- Major cleanup of the codebase (PR coming soon)
- Auto updater (WIP)
- Synchronisation (WIP)

## Lack of features
Altough most (if not all) of my *fancyfications* go directly against the original intentions of non-fancy [NoteBot](http://notebot.fdossena.com/).
To quote [NoteBot](http://notebot.fdossena.com/) developer [Federico Dossena](https://github.com/adolfintel):
> Sticky Notes became trash with the August 2016 update of Windows 10, which turned it into a "modern" app, and added useless and suspicious features like synchronization and telemetry.

These "features" from [NoteBot](http://notebot.fdossena.com/) have survived *fancyfication*:
- Not a "modern" app, you can obliterate all Metro apps from your PC
- No taskbar icon, notes actually stick to the desktop
~~- No synchronization~~
~~- No auto updater~~
- No telemetry
- No botnet, it's open source, you can trust this application
- No ugly Segoe Script font

## Compatibility
- Windows XP or newer
- Any platform supported by Java SE 7 or newer
 
## Usage
